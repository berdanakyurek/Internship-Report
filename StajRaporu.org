  This summer, I completed my second summer internship at BK Mobil, which is a software company
  specialized in education domain. I choose this company because I find education sector morally
  more appropriate for me, since I find working in industries like finance and defense morally
  problematic. BK Mobil is a company that is creating only education applications, therefore it was
  a good option for me.

  During my internship, I worked on the front-end of three different projects which are called
  Mentonet, Metodbox and Metodbox Club which are all used by students and school staff to increase
  the efficiency of the learning process. During the internship, I learned a lot. First of all, I
  learned a new technology, ReactJS, which I had no experience before. Secondly, I learned a lot
  about the development processes of a real-life project. I am very happy to be a part of real
  projects that will be used by real people.

  During the rest of the report, there will be a part where I give brief information about the
  company where I completed my internship, a part about the details of the work I have done and a
  section where I explain how I satisfy the expectations of the University.

  At the end of the report, there are screenshots of the projects I worked on. All user names
  including test users are censored in the screenshots, due to the company restrictions.

* Company Information

** About the company

   The internship is completed in the company BK Mobil[cite:@bkmobil]. BK Mobil is a software
   company focused on education technologies. It's main office is located in Bilkent Cyberpark. It
   also has two other offices in Ankara and Istanbul.

   The main product of BK Mobil is called Metodbox[cite:@metodbox]. It is an online learning
   platform that is used by primary and high school students. It is available as a website and
   mobile applications for Android and IOS operating systems. It consists of many features like
   lectures, lecture videos, exam reports, performance metrics for students. Also, it is used
   integrated with teachers, administrative staff and parents. Teachers and administrative staff use
   Metodbox for assigning homework, communicating with students using instant messaging feature, and
   tracking individual or success of students. Lastly, parents can use Metodbox to keep updated
   about the progress of their children. Metodbox also uses AI concepts to implement some advanced
   features like grading automation, information review adaptive learning and personalized
   learning. Other than Metodbox, BK Mobil also has a video conferencing solution
   SeeMeet[cite:@seemeet], a project based learning platform Metodbox Bee[cite:@metodboxbee] and
   specific applications implemented for Uğur Schools and Bahçeşehir College.

** About your department

   During the internship, I became a part of web development department. Since most BK Mobil
   products are available as both mobile and web, there are departments responsible for both of
   them. I was in the team that was responsible from the web front-end.

** About the hardware and software systems

   The company was flexible in terms of hardware and software. Although they offered to give me a
   laptop, I had the option to use my own computer. Therefore, I used my own laptop instead of
   theirs. However, the laptops of the company are mostly Dell computers with Windows operating
   system. However, there were people using Mac and Linux computers as well.

   The company uses Bitbucket[cite:@bitbucket] for source code hosting. For the project I worked on,
   ReactJS[cite:@react] is used for developing the front-end.

** About your supervisor

   During my internship, my supervisor was Ahmet İlhan Aydoğdu. He is graduated from Pamukkale
   University, Department of Computer Engineering in 2017. He works as a software developer in
   BK mobil for four years. He also has similar experience in two other companies as a Software
   Engineer.
   # The supervisor’s name and job title, along with his or her university and department and year of graduation must be stated here.

* Work Done
  # This section can have one or more subsections. It is up to you. But this section should be detailed enough.

** Learning React

   In the first day of my internship, my supervisor asked me which technologies I have experience
   with. Since my company is a mobile and web company, I told them my mobile application experience
   which I acquired during my CS102 project and my Senior project using Java. He asked more
   specifically about my web experience with JavaScript and ReactJS. Since I had no experience with
   them, my supervisor asked me to learn them at first by following tutorials and implement a basic
   project with the tutorials.

   I started learning React with a YouTube tutorial[cite:@reactin30mins]. While watching the
   tutorial, I tried to do the coding on my own as well. The tutorial was on implementing a todo
   list with adding todo, marking todos as completed or not completed and clearing completed
   todos. I implemented the list according to the tutorial. After completing the tutorial, I wanted
   to add some extra features that were not present in the original tutorial. Therefore, I added
   filtering feature, where user can filter todos as all todos, only completed todos or only active
   todos. Lastly, I added a Dark mode feature where user can choose to use dark mode instead of
   white mode. I  pushed the resulting project in a public GitHub
   repository[cite:@reacttest]. Appendix 1 shows a screenshot of the project.

*** Learning Service Usage
    After learning React generally, my supervisor asked me to implement a project that uses an API
    and using services. Specifically, he asked me to implement a project from a YouTube
    tutorial[cite:@code15projects]. The aim is to implement a website that displays different tours
    by fetching data from an API. User can click on "Not interested" button for each tour to hide
    it. When the page is refreshed, all content is fetched again. After understanding what it does,
    I implemented the project on my own, without following the tutorial. I focused on technical side
    like using services rather than aesthetics. I pushed the resulting project in a public GitHub
    repository[cite:@reacttour]. Appendix 2 shows a screenshot of the project.

*** Learning React Routers
    After completing my first project and checking with my supervisor, my supervisor asked me to
    learn two more concepts, which are Routers and Redux and show them in projects. Therefore, I
    started with learning Routers.

    In order to learn what Routers are and how they are used in React, I used a documentation about
    it[cite:@routerdoc]. Routers are React components that are used for easy navigation among
    different pages. In order to test my knowledge, I implemented a simple template web page that
    have a home page, an about page and a contact page, where users can switch among pages using the
    navigation bar on top of each page and navigation is done with React Routers.

    In this simple project, communication cost between client and server is reduced. In a classic
    web page, every time user switches among two pages, a new request is sent to the server and new
    web page content is sent back by the server. However, using React and Routers, this is reduced
    to a single request. At the first connection, user takes the contents of pages and loading
    another page is done on the client-side. I pushed the resulting project in a public GitHub
    repository again[cite:@routerexample]. Appendix 3 shows a screenshot of the project.

*** Learning React Redux
    Later, I started learning about Redux and its usage with React. In order to do this, I followed
    a YouTube tutorial again[cite:@reduxtutorial]. In React, data can be passed among React
    components in a single direction, among parent and child. However, it cannot be passed among
    siblings. In order to two Component to use the same data, the data must be stored at least in
    their lowest common ancestor. Therefore, data is tend to be stored somewhere else than the
    places it is used. This creates a lack of organization. This problems can be solved with
    Redux. With Redux, data is stored in a distinct place where it is accessible from components by
    methods provided by the library.

    In order to see a working example of Redux, I implemented a simple counter following a
    tutorial[cite:@reduxtutorial]. There is a counter with initial value zero and there are two
    buttons to increment and decrement the counter value by one. Although it is not very convenient
    to use Redux in this project, it was useful to learn because it takes time to set up Redux and
    it is easier to not to use in small projects. However, it was helpful to learn how the concept
    works. The resulting project is pushed in a public GitHub
    repository[cite:@reduxexample]. Appendix 4 shows a screenshot of the project.

** Mentonet
   After completing all tasks and checking them with my supervisor, I am granted access to a real
   project which is called Mentonet[cite:@mentonet]. This project is a website for sharing surveys
   with students. It is still not deployed and under development. It is being developed using
   ReactJS. Its source code is stored in Bitbucket.

*** Setup and Adaptation
    In order to start the project, I created a Bitbucket account and company invited me to the
    repository. I cloned the repository and made necessary configurations in order to run it
    locally. Later I examined the website by simply using it without checking the code. Later, I
    started from main component and tried to understand its working by tracing the code. I made
    minor changes in the code when necessary, in order to understand what each component do. This
    way I familiarized myself with the code and its organization. This way I could know where to
    look when I need something.

*** Settings Page
    After getting used to the project, my supervisor asked me to implement the settings page of
    Mentonet. Using this page, an administrator can set the settings like the deadline and the goal
    of the survey. Similarly, it is possible to set which degrees are going to solve the survey
    using this screen as well. A screenshot of this screen is included in Appendix 5.

*** Formatting Surveys List
    After completing the Settings page, my supervisor asked me to format the survey list page. In
    this page, a user can see the list of surveys he/she is authorized to see. Administrators can
    click the button next to each survey in the list to edit the survey or guests can click a
    similar button next to each list item in order to solve that survey. This page was already
    implemented, however I formatted this page so that more information is displayed, and full
    description of the survey is displayed on a popover when hovered on a list item. Necessary
    changes are done on the routers in order to display different buttons for administrators and
    guests. A screenshot of this screen is included in Appendix 6.

*** Solve Survey Page
    When I completed all work with the surveys list, I am asked to implement survey solving
    page. This page is designed for guests to solve the surveys. In this page, each question of
    different possible types is displayed sequentially. User can mark or type his/her answers and
    can submit the form by clicking on a button. Implementation of this page is done using the
    implementation of survey creation page. Since survey creation page is similar to survey solving
    page, it was possible to make some changes on the code to implement the new code, instead of
    starting from scratch. A screenshot of this page is included in Appendix 7.

*** Solving Layout Problems
    After implementing the previous features, my supervisor realized an unexpected shift in the
    layout and asked me to correct it. It was surprising because I did not do anything about the
    layout. I switched back to my previous commits to understand where exactly the problem
    occurs. After finding the commit the error started to occur, we tried to figure out why it is
    broken. I compared execution of previous version with current one. I copied and pasted each line
    of code to new version and figured out which line exactly was the problem and solved
    it. Appendix 8 shows a screenshot of the layout problem that is solved.

** Metodbox
   When the above tasks were completed, my supervisor asked me to move to another project, called
   Metodbox. Because Mentonet was a new project and there were a lot of decisions that must be done
   beforehand. Therefore, I moved to Mentonet. Mentonet is also a React project. As explained in the
   company information part, it is an AI based learning platform. It is used by many students and
   teachers from different schools.

*** Adaptation to the Project
    After being authorized to the code, I cloned the repository and made necessary configurations to
    run it locally. Similar to what I did in the previous project Mentonet, I followed the code and
    tried to understand the code. Shortly, the first task of my project is assigned to me.

*** Selected Week Homeworks Does Not Update Bug
    The first task that is assigned to me was to solve a small bug. In the system, there is a user
    interface where user selects a week from the calendar and the homeworks of that week is
    displayed. However, this function were not working and only the homeworks of the current week
    was displayed due to a bug. My task was to solve this bug. In order to do this, I tracked the
    code to the place where the calendar is defined. Later I printed the necessary variables to
    understand what was the problem and realized that a particular variable was always returning
    empty. Later, I followed the variable starting from its definition and each change of
    it. Finally, I found the place where the error occurs and solved it. Although the total change I
    made was around five lines of code, it took me hours to figure out the problem before making the
    necessary change. A screenshot of this page is included in Appendix 9.

*** Class Card Modifications
    After solving my first bug of the project, I am asked to make two more changes. These were due
    to a user interface where users see their classes of the day. In this screen, on the corner of
    each class, there were information about it as "Not started yet", "Ongoing" or
    "Completed". However, according to the requirements, this information need to be visible only
    for students but not teachers. Therefore, it should be absent in the case of a teacher
    account. Similarly, there are badges on the bottom of each class card which shows progress of
    students by colors. It appears in gray if student has no progress, in blue if student is started
    but not completed yet, in green if student completed the task. However, in teachers, all the
    badges appear in gray because teacher does not have progress. My task is to make them all orange
    in the teacher dashboard. Similar to previous task, I tracked the code to the place where the
    component is defined and added a user type control to define the color and the existence of
    badges. Screenshot of student page and both old and new versions are in Appendix 10;

*** Metodbox Club
    After completing the previous parts, I moved to a new project called Metodbox Club. Although it
    is a separate project, it can be considered as a part of Metodbox due to their integration and
    together use. Using Metodbox Club, student clubs of schools are organized and managed
    easily. Using Metodbox Club, administrators can decide which clubs will be opened and they can
    organize them under categories, sub-categories and groups. Also they can decide on which clubs
    will be active for each semester. Teachers can be assigned to clubs, new clubs can be generated
    or existing clubs can be deleted etc. Similarly, teachers can manage the clubs they are
    responsible of using Metodbox Club. Lastly, students can select and enroll clubs using Metodbox
    Club. It is still under development but it is expected to complete it before the Fall semester
    begins.

**** Club Creation Page
     As my first task, I am asked to design the club creation screen. In this screen, an
     administrator needs to type the club information like name, grades that are able to join that
     club, description etc. This way, custom clubs can be generated. I designed this page as shown
     in Appendix 11. Later, I am asked to do the necessary API connections with back-end. To do
     this, I am asked to install Postman[cite:@postman]. I installed and learned to send requests
     with it. After trying and testing requests with Postman, I embedded the requests into code and
     made it work. Page is taking category, subcategory and group names that are shown in the
     screenshot are taken from API via a GET request as well as grade options under the drop-down
     menu. Similarly, the collected information is sent to the API via a POST request to create a
     new club. Lastly, when user tries to cancel club creation, it is asked to the user whether
     he/she is sure or not.

**** File Upload
     After creating a new club, users can upload files to it. This way necessary club documentation
     is shared with students and teachers. In order to do this, I designed a file upload page as
     shown in Appendix 12. It was possible to select a file using this page however due to the
     problems in the API, it was not possible to send it to the server.

**** Catalog Page
     Catalog page is the page where administrator can see a list of clubs. In this list, he/she can
     filter the clubs by category, subcategory, group or grade. Filtering is done on the client side
     since API does not provide a function to fetch clubs with filters. By selecting a season and
     semester and clicking the checkbox next to a club, he/she can enable or disable that club for
     that semester. Lastly, he/she can preview and edit a club by clicking the eye button next to
     it. This page is designed and made working by doing necessary API connections. A screenshot of
     this page is included in Appendix 13.

**** Club Edit
     When a club is selected to edit from the catalog, club edit page is displayed. This page is
     actually exactly the same as create club page. However, in this case fields are not empty but
     they have default values. Therefore, instead of creating a new page, I edited the club create
     page by passing a club ID parameter. If there is no parameter passed to page, the fields come
     empty and results are sent via a POST request. However, if parameter is passed, the information
     of the club is fetched via e GET request and when clicked on save button, result is sent with a
     PUT request instead of POST to update values.

**** Modifications in Categories Page
     Categories Page shows categories, subcategories and groups in a hierarchical view as shown in
     Appendix 14. Some modifications are done in this page as described below.

***** Add Club Button
      Next to each group item, a plus button is added. When this button is clicked, club creation
      page opens with the information of that category, subcategory and group.

***** Category Setting Button
      Next to each category, a settings button is added. When this button is clicked, a Modal Box
      pops up and it is possible to manage settings of that category in this Modal Box.

***** Category Settings Modal Box
      In this modal box, it is possible to select the lower and upper limits of clubs that can be
      joined from a particular category. A screenshot of this page is included in Appendix 15. After
      collecting the necessary information and getting the button click, it sends the information
      collected to the API. This page appears whenever settings button is clicked on categories page.

**** Manager Edit Page
     Later, I am asked to implement manager edit page. In this page, a manager can edit a club by
     setting the section numbers, the quota for each section and assigning teachers for each
     section. I implemented this page as requested. A screenshot of the resulting page is provided
     in the Appendix 16.

**** Student Assignment Page
     After completing the manager edit page, I implemented the student assignment page. In this
     page, a manager can see a list of students. He/she can start an automatic assignment by using
     this page. Other than that, he/she can able to assign students to clubs manually. After
     designing the page, necessary API connections are done and the page is made
     functional. Screenshots of this page can be found on Appendix 17.

**** Bug Fixes and Improvements
     Lastly, I am provided with a test document where detected bugs and problems are documented. I
     used this document to fix bugs like wrong date formats and some functionalities are not working
     as expected. Therefore, I fixed the bugs that are related to the parts that is implemented by
     me.

* Performance and Outcomes
  # You must have all these sections in your report.

** Solving Complex Engineering Problems

   During my internship, I faced many complex engineering problems and I used my problem solving
   skills as much as I can to solve them. The first and most important engineering problem was
   efficiency. Sometimes when I do something, I realized that it is not as efficient as it should
   be. This leads to a non-responsive user experience. Therefore, I needed to find more efficient
   ways to improve the user experience. Whenever it is hard to solve this problem on front-end, I
   asked to back-end team to provide me some new API's. Especially for sorting and searching
   problems, I could not achieve the required efficiency on front end, therefore search and sort is
   done on back-end. However, I also realized that there are many jobs that I perform
   inefficiently. During the internship, I learned to overcome this and write more efficient code as
   much as I can.

** Recognizing Ethical and Professional Responsibilities

   During my internship, I faced some ethical and professional responsibilities. I understood these
   responsibilities and followed them during my internship.

*** Ethical Responsibilities

    While implementing the tasks that are assigned to me, ethical responsibilities are followed. For
    example, while implementing Mentonet, although there are easier ways to do something, the most
    efficient way is searched. This way unnecessary resource usage is prevented. This way the users
    can reach the content provided with small amount of data, battery, CPU usage etc. This is an
    ethical responsibility of the developer against both the users and the nature. For example,
    instead of sending request for each page each time, routers are used and navigation among pages
    is done on client side. This way the communication cost is reduced.

*** Professional Responsibilities

    Similarly, I had professional responsibilities too. For example, while writing code, I tried to
    make it as readable as possible. Since I am not the only person that is working on this project
    and I am only an intern, the project will be maintained by other people. Therefore, leaving them
    a readable code increases their productivity and this is my responsibility to the company. In
    order to keep the code readable, I tried to make variable names as self-explanatory as
    possible and write components in an organized way. I tried to follow code conventions and
    organization styles I face while reading the code. As another professional responsibility, I
    protected the company code and I did not share any company code or document with people that are
    outside of the company.


** Making Informed Judgments

   During my internship, I considered the impacts of the projects I worked on in global, economical,
   environmental and social context. Since the projects were real projects with many real users, it
   is expected that it has a high impact. Firstly, although BK Mobil products are currently used by
   the schools in Turkey, they are all generic products and they are meant to be used by any
   school. Therefore, the open to be used in a global scale and it is expected to have a positive
   impact on the students and teachers from all over the world. Secondly, BK Mobil products increase
   the efficiency of teaching process. The increase in the efficiency leads to economical impact
   since the value produced can be increased or required labor is decreased. Therefore, the project
   I worked on has an economical impact. Third, BK Mobil products does not expected to have any
   environmental impact, since it is not directly connected to any environment related use
   case. Lastly, in terms of social impacts, the products I worked on are used in order to improve
   the communication both between students and between students and teachers. For example, using
   Metodbox Club, student clubs are encouraged and made functional. This has a positive social
   impact on students.

** Acquiring New Knowledge by Using Appropriate Learning Strategies

   The tools that are used during my internship mostly were not familiar to me. Before my
   internship, I had no experience with web development and ReactJS. Therefore, I was not qualified
   enough to contribute to a real project. Therefore I am asked to learn React by my
   supervisor. Also, I learned sub-concepts of React by implementing small projects. In order to do
   this, I used YouTube videos. However, instead of simply watching a video, I made the
   implementation and even took them further. This was the main strategy I used for learning.

** Applying New Knowledge As Needed

   The knowledge learned and explained in the previous section are used during the tasks assigned to
   me. Programming with React, which was a new skill for me was used in real-life project called
   Mentonet and Metodbox. Sub-concepts like Redux and Routers are also very useful in both
   projects. The transitions between pages are implemented in an organized and readable way using
   React routers. Similarly, the communication between front-end and back-end are handled using
   Redux with a similar organized and readable approach.

* Conclusions
  # Here you will write your conclusions. You can discuss your training and the company as
  # well. Give a summary of the most important things you learned.

  In conclusion, I had a good internship experience this summer. I became a part of a real team and
  observed the good and bad sides of the working environment. I learned the differences between
  university and industry. The expectations of the industry is much different compared to the
  expectations of the university. Similarly, I had many team work experience which are very
  different from the university group projects. Working in a company was much more planned,
  organized and professional. Lastly, I realized how important was the knowledge I learned in
  university in working life.
