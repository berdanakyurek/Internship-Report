   mobile applications for Android and IOS operating systems. It consists of many features like
   lectures, lecture videos, exam reports, performance metrics for students. Also, it is used
   integrated with teachers, administrative staff and parents. Teachers and administrative staff use
   Metodbox for assigning homework, communicating with students using instant messaging feature, and
   tracking individual or success of students. Lastly, parents can use Metodbox to keep updated
   about the progress of their children. Metodbox also uses AI concepts to implement some advanced
   features like grading automation, information review adaptive learning and personalized
   learning. Other than Metodbox, BK Mobil also has a video conferencing solution
   SeeMeet[cite:@seemeet], a project based learning platform Metodbox Bee[cite:@metodboxbee] and
   specific applications implemented for Uğur Schools and Bahçeşehir College.

** About your department

** About the hardware and software systems

   The company was flexible in terms of hardware and software. Although they offered to give me a
   laptop, I had the option to use my own computer. Therefore, I used my own laptop instead of
   theirs. However, the laptops of the company are mostly Dell computers with Windows operating
   system. However, there were people using Mac and Linux computers as well.

   The company uses Bitbucket[cite:@bitbucket] for source code hosting. For the project I worked on,
   ReactJS[cite:@react] is used for developing the front-end.

** About your supervisor

   During my internship, my supervisor was Ahmet İlhan Aydoğdu. He is graduated from Pamukkale
   University, Department of Computer Engineering in 2017. He works as a software developer in
   BK mobil for four years. He also has similar experience in two other companies as a Software
   Engineer.
   # The supervisor’s name and job title, along with his or her university and department and year of graduation must be stated here.

* Work Done
  # This section can have one or more subsections. It is up to you. But this section should be detailed enough.

** Learning React

   In the first day of my internship, my supervisor asked me which technologies I have experience
   with. Since my company is a mobile and web company, I told them my mobile application experience
   which I acquired during my CS102 project and my Senior project using Java. He asked more
   specifically about my web experience with JavaScript and ReactJS. Since I had no experience with
   them, my supervisor asked me to learn them at first by following tutorials and implement a basic
   project with the tutorials.

   I started learning React with a YouTube tutorial[cite:@reactin30mins]. While watching the
   tutorial, I tried to do the coding on my own as well. The tutorial was on implementing a todo
   list with adding todo, marking todos as completed or not completed and clearing completed
   todos. I implemented the list according to the tutorial. After completing the tutorial, I wanted
   to add some extra features that were not present in the original tutorial. Therefore, I added
   filtering feature, where user can filter todos as all todos, only completed todos or only active
   todos. Lastly, I added a Dark mode feature where user can choose to use dark mode instead of
   white mode. I  pushed the resulting project in a public GitHub
   repository[cite:@reacttest]. Appendix 1 shows a screenshot of the project.

*** Learning Service Usage
    After learning React generally, my supervisor asked me to implement a project that uses an API
    and using services. Specifically, he asked me to implement a project from a YouTube
    tutorial[cite:@code15projects]. The aim is to implement a website that displays different tours
    by fetching data from an API. User can click on "Not interested" button for each tour to hide
    it. When the page is refreshed, all content is fetched again. After understanding what it does,
    I implemented the project on my own, without following the tutorial. I focused on technical side
    like using services rather than aesthetics. I pushed the resulting project in a public GitHub
    repository[cite:@reacttour]. Appendix 2 shows a screenshot of the project.

*** Learning React Routers
    After completing my first project and checking with my supervisor, my supervisor asked me to
    learn two more concepts, which are Routers and Redux and show them in projects. Therefore, I
    started with learning Routers.

    In order to learn what Routers are and how they are used in React, I used a documentation about
    it[cite:@routerdoc]. Routers are React components that are used for easy navigation among
    different pages. In order to test my knowledge, I implemented a simple template web page that
    have a home page, an about page and a contact page, where users can switch among pages using the
    navigation bar on top of each page and navigation is done with React Routers.

    In this simple project, communication cost between client and server is reduced. In a classic
    web page, every time user switches among two pages, a new request is sent to the server and new
    web page content is sent back by the server. However, using React and Routers, this is reduced
    to a single request. At the first connection, user takes the contents of pages and loading
    another page is done on the client-side. I pushed the resulting project in a public GitHub
    repository again[cite:@routerexample]. Appendix 3 shows a screenshot of the project.

*** Learning React Redux
    Later, I started learning about Redux and its usage with React. In order to do this, I followed
    a YouTube tutorial again[cite:@reduxtutorial]. In React, data can be passed among React
    components in a single direction, among parent and child. However, it cannot be passed among
    siblings. In order to two Component to use the same data, the data must be stored at least in
    their lowest common ancestor. Therefore, data is tend to be stored somewhere else than the
    places it is used. This creates a lack of organization. This problems can be solved with
    Redux. With Redux, data is stored in a distinct place where it is accessible from components by
    methods provided by the library.

    In order to see a working example of Redux, I implemented a simple counter following a
    tutorial[cite:@reduxtutorial]. There is a counter with initial value zero and there are two
    buttons to increment and decrement the counter value by one. Although it is not very convenient
    to use Redux in this project, it was useful to learn because it takes time to set up Redux and
    it is easier to not to use in small projects. However, it was helpful to learn how the concept
    works. The resulting project is pushed in a public GitHub
    repository[cite:@reduxexample]. Appendix 4 shows a screenshot of the project.

** Mentonet
   After completing all tasks and checking them with my supervisor, I am granted access to a real
   project which is called Mentonet[cite:@mentonet]. This project is a website for sharing surveys
   with students. It is still not deployed and under development. It is being developed using
   ReactJS. Its source code is stored in Bitbucket.

*** Setup and Adaptation
    In order to start the project, I created a Bitbucket account and company invited me to the
    repository. I cloned the repository and made necessary configurations in order to run it
    locally. Later I examined the website by simply using it without checking the code. Later, I
    started from main component and tried to understand its working by tracing the code. I made
    minor changes in the code when necessary, in order to understand what each component do. This
    way I familiarized myself with the code and its organization. This way I could know where to
    look when I need something.

*** Settings Page
    After getting used to the project, my supervisor asked me to implement the settings page of
    Mentonet. Using this page, an administrator can set the settings like the deadline and the goal
    of the survey. Similarly, it is possible to set which degrees are going to solve the survey
    using this screen as well. A screenshot of this screen is included in Appendix 5.

*** Formatting Surveys List
    After completing the Settings page, my supervisor asked me to format the survey list page. In
    this page, a user can see the list of surveys he/she is authorized to see. Administrators can
    click the button next to each survey in the list to edit the survey or guests can click a
    similar button next to each list item in order to solve that survey. This page was already
    implemented, however I formatted this page so that more information is displayed, and full
    description of the survey is displayed on a popover when hovered on a list item. Necessary
    changes are done on the routers in order to display different buttons for administrators and
    guests. A screenshot of this screen is included in Appendix 6.

*** Solve Survey Page
    When I completed all work with the surveys list, I am asked to implement survey solving
    page. This page is designed for guests to solve the surveys. In this page, each question of
    different possible types is displayed sequentially. User can mark or type his/her answers and
    can submit the form by clicking on a button. Implementation of this page is done using the
    implementation of survey creation page. Since survey creation page is similar to survey solving
    page, it was possible to make some changes on the code to implement the new code, instead of
    starting from scratch. A screenshot of this page is included in Appendix 7.

*** Solving Layout Problems
    After implementing the previous features, my supervisor realized an unexpected shift in the
    layout and asked me to correct it. It was surprising because I did not do anything about the
    layout. I switched back to my previous commits to understand where exactly the problem
    occurs. After finding the commit the error started to occur, we tried to figure out why it is
    broken. I compared execution of previous version with current one. I copied and pasted each line
    of code to new version and figured out which line exactly was the problem and solved
    it. Appendix 8 shows a screenshot of the layout problem that is solved.

** Metodbox
   When the above tasks were completed, my supervisor asked me to move to another project, called
   Metodbox. Because Mentonet was a new project and there were a lot of decisions that must be done
   beforehand. Therefore, I moved to Mentonet. Mentonet is also a React project. As explained in the
   company information part, it is an AI based learning platform. It is used by many students and
   teachers from different schools.

*** Adaptation to the Project
    After being authorized to the code, I cloned the repository and made necessary configurations to
    run it locally. Similar to what I did in the previous project Mentonet, I followed the code and
    tried to understand the code. Shortly, the first task of my project is assigned to me.

*** Selected Week Homeworks Does Not Update Bug
    The first task that is assigned to me was to solve a small bug. In the system, there is a user
    interface where user selects a week from the calendar and the homeworks of that week is
    displayed. However, this function were not working and only the homeworks of the current week
    was displayed due to a bug. My task was to solve this bug. In order to do this, I tracked the
    code to the place where the calendar is defined. Later I printed the necessary variables to
    understand what was the problem and realized that a particular variable was always returning
    empty. Later, I followed the variable starting from its definition and each change of
    it. Finally, I found the place where the error occurs and solved it. Although the total change I
    made was around five lines of code, it took me hours to figure out the problem before making the
    necessary change. A screenshot of this page is included in Appendix 9.

*** Class Card Modifications
    After solving my first bug of the project, I am asked to make two more changes. These were due
    to a user interface where users see their classes of the day. In this screen, on the corner of
    each class, there were information about it as "Not started yet", "Ongoing" or
    "Completed". However, according to the requirements, this information need to be visible only
    for students but not teachers. Therefore, it should be absent in the case of a teacher
    account. Similarly, there are badges on the bottom of each class card which shows progress of
    students by colors. It appears in gray if student has no progress, in blue if student is started
    but not completed yet, in green if student completed the task. However, in teachers, all the
    badges appear in gray because teacher does not have progress. My task is to make them all orange
    in the teacher dashboard. Similar to previous task, I tracked the code to the place where the
    component is defined and added a user type control to define the color and the existence of
    badges. Screenshot of student page and both old and new versions are in Appendix 10;

* Performance and Outcomes
  # You must have all these sections in your report.

** Solving Complex Engineering Problems

** Recognizing Ethical and Professional Responsibilities

   During my internship, I faced some ethical and professional responsibilities. I understood these
   responsibilities and followed them during my internship.

*** Ethical Responsibilities

    While implementing the tasks that are assigned to me, ethical responsibilities are followed. For
    example, while implementing Mentonet, although there are easier ways to do something, the most
    efficient way is searched. This way unnecessary resource usage is prevented. This way the users
    can reach the content provided with small amount of data, battery, CPU usage etc. This is an
    ethical responsibility of the developer against both the users and the nature. For example,
    instead of sending request for each page each time, less requests are used and navigation among
    pages is done on client side. This way the communication cost is reduced.

*** Professional Responsibilities


** Making Informed Judgments

** Acquiring New Knowledge by Using Appropriate Learning Strategies

   The tools that are used during my internship mostly were not familiar to me. Before my
   internship, I had no experience with web development and ReactJS. Therefore, I was not qualified
   enough to contribute to a real project. Therefore I am asked to learn React by my
   supervisor. Also, I learned sub-concepts of React by implementing small projects. In order to do
   this, I used YouTube videos. However, instead of simply watching a video, I made the
   implementation and even took them further. This was the main strategy I used for learning.

** Applying New Knowledge As Needed

   The knowledge learned and explained in the previous section are used during the tasks assigned to
   me. Programming with React, which was a new skill for me was used in a real-life project called
   Mentonet. Sub-concepts like Redux and Routers are also very useful in Mentonet. The transitions
   between pages are implemented in an organized and readable way using React routers. Similarly,
   the communication between front-end and back-end are handled using Redux with a similar organized
   and readable approach.
